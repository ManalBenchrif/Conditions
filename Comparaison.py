#Python uses boolean variables to evaluate conditions.
#true id condition is true else false

x=5   #assignment is done using a single equals operator "="
print(x==5) # comparison between two variables is done using the double equals operator "==".
print(x==4) 
print(x>5) 
print(x!=6) #The "not equals" operator is marked as "!=".
